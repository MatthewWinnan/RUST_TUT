# Intro
The following repo is simply an environment to build `RUST` programs as I am learning the language.

All RUST projects are stored under `projects` and built using cargo while tool-chain and environment
versioning is being handled by `NIX`.

My first batch of projects will be based on [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
